My name is Will Bochnowicz. Welcome to my website!

!["A picture of myself!"]({{ site.url }}/assets/portrait.jpg){: width="50%"}

*Thank you for stopping by to look at my online portfolio!*

I am a senior at Penn State studying Computer Science. I’m extremely passionate about all things related to Linux, Systems Programming, and (recently) Programming Language Concepts. I’m looking to start a career in Systems Programming, where I have a particular interest in embedded devices. However, I have internship experience as a web developer and have been working part-time in IT for several years. This experience has given me valuable skills in a number of areas of technology and has informed the way that I approach technological problems.

I’m particularly proud of the projects that I’ve completed over the last several years, which can be found on the Personal Projects page of this website. If you’re a recruiter, feel free to check out my Resume as well!

You can reach me at [awill4me@gmail.com](mailto:awill4me@gmail.com), or look for me as [Will-Bo on GitHub](github.com/Will-Bo) or on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-bochnowicz-45a3542a2/).
